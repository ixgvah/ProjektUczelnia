# Academy Management System

<h3>Project for Wroclaw Institute of Science and Technology</h3>

A simple application for managing academy employees, students, and classes.
Built entirely in Java Swing as part of my studies.

This was my first bigger project using both structured and object-oriented programming approaches.
While it could definitely be improved, it helped me learn a lot about Java, GUI development, and program structure.

<h4>Main features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Manage students, teachers, and courses</li>
<li>Add, edit, and remove records</li>
<li>Basic GUI built with Java Swing</li>
<ul>
