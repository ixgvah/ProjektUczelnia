<h2>🎓 Academy Manager</h2>

<p>
  Project created for the <strong>Wroclaw Institute of Science and Technology</strong>. <br>
  This is my first full application for managing academy employees, students, and classes.
  It was built entirely in <strong>Java Swing</strong> as part of my studies.
</p>

<p>
  This was my first larger project using both structured and object-oriented programming approaches.
  While it could definitely be improved, it taught me a lot about Java, GUI development, and overall
  program structure.
